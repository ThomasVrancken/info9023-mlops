# INFO9023 - Machine Learning Systems Design [spring 2026]

This course equips students with the practical tools and frameworks needed to build production-ready machine learning systems. Covering the complete ML application lifecycle, students will gain hands-on experience with MLOps and LLMOps tools and skills in high demand as industries undergo rapid AI transformation.

Deploying ML to production requires far more than model theoretical knowledge. This course provides the technical skills, practices, and tools to bridge the gap between prototype and production. Students will be equipped to make a direct impact when starting their professional life.

## Course culture

#### Pillars
1. **Relevant**: Focused on core concepts of building ML/AI applications. Tailored choice of current best practices.
2. **Practical**: Concrete Labs, resources, real life examples, time to experiment, support line, …
3. **Engaging**: Interactive class session. Healthy tempo (break out exercises, QA, …). 

#### Learning Streams
1. **Lectures**: Present theoretical concepts and practices. Usually the first part of each class.
2. **Directed work**: Directed work are there to learn how to use key tools widely used to build ML/AI systems. They've been cherry picked based on usability, performance, popularity and accessibility. 
3. **Project**: You will apply the theoretical and technical learnings in one large group project. You will build a ML application in an engaging way - you're in the driving seat.


## Project 

All the project info can be found in the [project/project_instructions.pdf](project/project_instructions.pdf) document.

### Milestones

- MS1: You will pick a spot between the 2nd and the 5th of March. The exact spot available will be announced later.
- MS2: You will pick a spot between the 30th of March and the 2nd of April. The exact spot available will be announced later.
- MS3: Each group will present in the classroom, other groups can attend the presentation. It will be on the 11th of May.

## Exam 

The exam will take the form of an oral exam in which you will have to answer a series of 4-5 questions based on a case study. The case study will be given a hypothetical ML/AI application use case and you will have to answer different design questions based on the concepts taught during this course.

## Logistic
- **Teaching Staff**: 
  - Thomas Vrancken (Instructor)
  - Matthias Pirlet (Teaching Assistant)
- **Communication**: Main communication point will be Discord (link sent by email). Official communication might also be sent by email.
- **Support**: After each class, there is dedicated time for students to work on their projects and ask questions to the teaching staff.
